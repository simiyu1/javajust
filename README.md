Android Beginner Just Java minimal class

I put together this repo to guide users new to android to understand methods and variable declarations. All the code 
and concepts used have been provided by Andela through Udacity, all I have done is just organize one lesson into code. 

You will learn better if you create your own after understanding the concepts. The User interface has not been beautified in any way ..

Cheers :-)
